## What it is

Cloud Phone is a **local** web console for Android devices already connected via ADB.  
A Node backend pushes a customized **scrcpy 4.0** server with WebSocket streaming;  
the Vue frontend decodes H.264 with **WebCodecs** and speaks the **ws-scrcpy** wire protocol.

Mirror settings panels follow grouping ideas from **escrcpy**, but this repo is standalone – it does not depend on escrcpy at runtime.

**Good fit:** developers with USB/Wi‑Fi ADB, who want mirror options, files, apps, and shell in a single web UI — or a phone-side gallery + fullscreen cast against the same backend.  
**Not a fit:** “cloud phones” without ADB, or pure SaaS expectations.

---

## Highlights

- Browser cast with low-latency H.264 + touch/mouse injection (scrcpy 4.0)
- Official scrcpy **4.0** server fork with WebSocket on port **8886**
- Mirror + **camera** cast modes (OTG/UHID removed in v0.9.1)
- Files, app manager, and terminal **without** an active cast session
- **Multi-device concurrency**: per-device ADB locks so many phones can be controlled in parallel; same device allows concurrent WebSocket clients with serialized ADB ops
- Toolbar: navigation keys (press/hold), clipboard, record (MP4/MP3), screenshot flash
- Unified iconography via Lucide for key actions, with clearer focus-visible and hover feedback
- **Naive UI shell**: shared components across login, settings, logs, and modals; mobile web uses bottom tab navigation with logout/theme in Settings
- `npm run dev` waits for backend health before Vite; light/dark theme
- **i18n**: switch UI language in Settings (zh-CN, en-US, zh-TW, ja-JP, ko-KR); core shell strings localized
- **Activity log**: sidebar **Logs** tab with Debug / Info / Warn / Error levels and auth / navigation / device / cast / stream / settings / UI categories; search, filters, expandable JSON details
- **API security**: session cookie required; JSON payloads use AES-GCM after login; WebSocket upgrade requires session; expired sessions redirect to login; optional Remember password auto-retries on boot/expiry and prompts again if the password changed
- **Device entry**: top-right Add Device modal; Android USB / pair code / QR / **direct connect** (IP + ADB port for ReDroid, emulators, etc.); **HarmonyOS USB/HDC**; **Apple WDA** — Windows USB wizard (sign/install/connect), or Mac `tools/ios-wda-bridge.mjs` for LAN discovery
- **Termux host**: run the backend on Android via Termux as Linux (`scripts/install-termux.sh`); repo includes `backend/bin/scrcpy/linux/scrcpy-server` (no local Gradle build)
- **Docker/CI**: `docker-cloud-phone/` — Linux defaults to **host network** (shared host NICs, ADB/mDNS); Mac/Windows use `docker-compose.bridge.yml` overlay; multi-arch images + Actions
- **HarmonyOS cast**: HDC + uitest agent + JPEG stream; `cast/start` pushes agent and fport, `/cast/ws` starts the JPEG pipe and delivers frames; **scale/quality**; **real-time touch** (ECHO/hdckit `Gestures`); touch coords track display scale, landscape, and preview rotation; agents in `backend/assets/harmony/`
- **Multi-app cast**: new cast mode hides the left settings pane and fills the workspace with a Windows-style desktop; Win11 taskbar and Start menu (search + app grid from device launchers); launching an app opens a window with **its own WebSocket / virtual display and start_app** (drag / resize / minimize / maximize; multiple windows reuse one scrcpy process without tearing down peers; server forces capture restart when `start_app` changes); default virtual display is `1080×1920` / `1920×1080` by app orientation, windows dock above the taskbar and stay smaller than the desktop strip; host pushes the matching platform `scrcpy-server` jar (no stale linux jar shadowing); proxy preserves early `scrcpy_initial` / type-101 frames; windows auto-close when the app activity ends (including on secondary/virtual displays); if virtual display creation fails (e.g. Android 15 OEM missing ADD_TRUSTED_DISPLAY), a dialog offers close / retry / switch to mirror cast; **Start menu icons are cached in the browser (IndexedDB) and only re-fetched on first load or fingerprint change for instant open**; Icon Helper progress modal only on first setup, then silent background sync for cached icons; Quick Settings controls Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Airplane mode and volume / brightness; notification center polls device notifications every second while open
- **iOS cast**: WebDriverAgent MJPEG (port 9100) + HTTP touch; place `wda.ipa` in `backend/bin/wda/` for the Windows sign/install wizard, or use Mac `iproxy` + `ios-wda-bridge.mjs` for LAN bridge; browser cast with nav keys
- **Android companion app**: same backend — device gallery, full Settings page, cast workspace, landscape fullscreen H.264 cast; stream params aligned with web
- **Mobile cast UX**: mirror nav keys / camera torch & zoom; Material motion; auto-hiding chrome; touch mapping with letterboxing

## Features

### Device gallery

![Device gallery](images/readme/gallery.png)

- Tabs: **Devices**, **Group control**, **Logs**, **Settings**
- Uses bundled `platform-tools` ADB and **HDC** (`backend/bin/hdc`; Windows includes `libusb_shared.dll`) to discover devices
- Shows model, manufacturer, IP, Android/HarmonyOS version, serial, product name
- Screenshot refresh ~5s by default (configurable), list refresh ~1s
- Keeps the previous frame while updating to avoid full-page loading flicker
- Online/offline counts, last refresh time, manual refresh; scrollable gallery for many devices with lazy screenshot loading
- Backend caps screenshot concurrency (max 4) and returns retryable status when a device is offline or ADB drops, avoiding `unhandledRejection` noise
- **Right-click a device card**: view device details or disconnect wireless devices (USB connections cannot be disconnected)
- Click a card to open the **device workspace**

### Activity log (web)

- Sidebar **Logs** tab records key console actions and streaming events
- Four severity levels (Debug / Info / Warn / Error) and seven categories (auth, navigation, device, cast, stream, settings, UI)
- Keyword search, level/category filters, clear log; each entry expands to JSON details (cast options, stream timeline, page-exit reason, etc.)
- Cast startup logs (scrcpy / HarmonyOS / iOS) are bridged into the global log automatically

### Group control (web)

- **+** opens a device picker: choose online devices to add (select-all, names, screenshot previews)
- Added devices cast inline in a grid (1080p / 30 fps / 4 Mbps) without opening the device workspace; touch inside the cast to control
- Click outside the cast area to toggle control selection; toolbar select-all / deselect-all; all added devices selected by default; new online devices auto-join
- With at least one device selected, batch actions: **power** (screen on/off), **volume** (mute/up/down), **apps** (batch APK install / uninstall by package), **batch control** (master yellow, followers green, mirrored input)
- Device list and control selection persist separately in browser `localStorage`
- Backend probes the local forward port before the cast pipe is ready; stopping a cast or server exit aborts the WebSocket proxy immediately (no `ECONNREFUSED` retry storm)

### Settings & auth (web)

- Horizontal settings page with secondary nav: **Account**, **Appearance**, **Refresh**
- **Account**: password status (default / updated), session expiry, change password
- **Appearance**: UI language (zh-CN, en-US, zh-TW, ja-JP, ko-KR), light/dark theme; stored in browser `localStorage`
- **Refresh**: device list and screenshot poll intervals (1–120 s, defaults 1 s / 5 s); takes effect immediately after save
- Session login (default password `admin`, please change it); AES-GCM on JSON APIs after login
- **Backend local data**: `backend/node/data/` holds `auth.key` and `cloud-phone.db` on disk only—never commit this directory

> **Note:** Files, app manager, and ADB terminal are **web workspace** features today. The Android app focuses on discovery, cast settings, and fullscreen remote control — see [Android app](#android-app).

### Device workspace · Mirror cast (default)

![Mirror cast](images/readme/mirror-cast.png)

**Left panel** (Naive UI collapses; all selects use the searchable `MirrorSearchableSelect`):

| Group | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Video** | Long-edge resolution, bitrate, FPS, encoder (device `list_encoders` with timeout + fallback), capture orientation, preview-only rotation |
| **Audio** | Enable/disable, audio source, `audio-code`, bitrate, `audio-dup` (Android 13+); can **disable video** and keep audio-only (waveform + PCM, Android 11+) |
| **Device** | Display id, screen-off casting, keep-awake, show touches, screen-off timeout, etc. |
| **Screen** | Virtual display presets, `--new-display` custom resolution/DPI, `--flex-display`, IME policy, system decorations; `--start-app` launches on the virtual display |

**Cast pipeline**

- `POST .../cast/start` to start; browser connects to `WebSocket .../cast/ws`; `cast/start` and `cast/status` return `startupLogs` (adb push, forward, shell, etc.)
- The right canvas shows startup logs while connecting (including frontend scrcpy ready); logs **hide after the first rendered frame**; fullscreen uses the same canvas overlay
- Non-fullscreen toolbar is docked below the device name; fullscreen keeps the floating toolbar
- Device runs a locally built **scrcpy-server 4.0** (backend auto-builds via Gradle when missing)
- Startup kills leftover `com.genymobile.scrcpy.Server` processes to avoid port **8886** conflicts
- Stream extras go over WebSocket type **101** (`codecOptions` / stream extras); left panel locks while casting to avoid accidental edits
- Touch coordinates use the **decoded video size**, aligned with server `PositionMapper`; mouse hover/press/drag/release follow scrcpy SDK semantics

**Toolbar** (Lucide-style icon + label)

- Recents, home, back, screen off, power, rotate (syncs preview rotation, +90° clockwise)
- Volume: expands into “up / down” sub-buttons
- Clipboard: paste host clipboard into device / copy device clipboard to host; also supports sending typed text
- Screenshot: downloads PNG even without an active cast; when casting, the viewport flashes white around the edges
- Record: MP4 when video is on, MP3 when audio-only; saved automatically when the cast ends
- **Files**, **Apps**, **Terminal** buttons open the tools below (no cast required)

### Device workspace · Camera cast (Android 12+)

![Camera cast](images/readme/camera-cast.png)

- Left “Camera” panel: facing, camera id, capture size, aspect ratio, FPS, high-speed mode, torch, zoom, encoder, audio
- `GET /api/devices/:serial/cameras` lists available cameras
- In-cast torch and zoom controls
- Canvas touch injection is disabled in camera mode to avoid accidental taps

### Files

![File explorer](images/readme/files.png)

- Filesystem root is `/`, default folder is `/storage/emulated/0`
- Real absolute path in the address bar
- Back / forward / up / refresh
- “Permission denied” errors are surfaced clearly
- **Upload** local files to the current directory (`PUT .../files/upload?path=`)
- **Download** device files to the host (`GET .../files/download?path=`)
- `GET /api/devices/:serial/files?path=...` lists a directory

### Apps

![App manager](images/readme/apps.png)

- App label via scrcpy-server `PackageManager` (`list_all_apps`), plus package name and system/frozen badges
- Detail modal: version, SDK, data directory, etc.
- Uninstall (with confirmation), user-level freeze/unfreeze, export APK, open `dataDir` in the file explorer
- Install from a local APK: `PUT .../apps/install`

### Terminal

![ADB terminal](images/readme/terminal.png)

- xterm.js terminal; supports Tab, arrows, and ANSI colors
- `WebSocket .../terminal/ws` bridges to `adb shell -tt`

### Backend & misc

- `GET /health`, `GET /api/devices`, `GET .../screenshot`
- ADB tasks use per-device serial locks: parallel across devices, serialized per device; multiple users on one phone share concurrent WebSockets
- scrcpy session API: `/api/scrcpy/*` for capabilities and programmatic sessions
- Tools: `tools/build-scrcpy-server.mjs`, `compare-scrcpy-upstream.mjs`, `sync-scrcpy-from-upstream.mjs`, `build-scrcpy.mjs`, `download-scrcpy.mjs`, `sync-scrcpy-source.mjs`
- OTG / UHID cast modes have been removed; only **mirror** and **camera** remain

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

## Android app

Source: `frontend/android/`. Uses the same Node backend and session model as the web UI — handy on the LAN for watching device screens and driving them fullscreen from a phone.

### Connect & sign in

- First launch: server **host** defaults to the LAN gateway (`.1` on the current subnet, e.g. `192.168.31.1`), **port** `3000`
- Same flow as web: ping → forced password change while still `admin` → login; password stored encrypted for auto sign-in next time
- Settings: **Log out** or **Change server** (clears session and saved password, returns to the connection screen)

### Device gallery (bottom tab · Devices)

- Horizontal cards with model, online state, and live screenshots (default ~5 s refresh, configurable in Settings)
- Device list polls about every **1 s**; pull-to-refresh; keeps the previous screenshot frame to reduce flicker
- **Long-press a device card**: view device details or disconnect wireless devices (USB connections cannot be disconnected)
- **+** add device: USB guide, wireless **pairing code**, **QR** pairing (aligned with the web Add Device modal)
- **Community Material** icons (Android-Iconics), consistent with web MDI

### Settings (bottom tab · Settings)

Mirrors the web `SettingsPanel` sections:

| Section | Features |
|---|---|
| **Account** | Password status, session expiry, change password (bottom sheet), log out |
| **Appearance** | UI locale preference (5 codes), light/dark theme (Material3 DayNight) |
| **Refresh** | Device list / screenshot intervals (1–120 s); Devices tab polling picks up new values immediately |
| **Server** | Current `host:port`, switch server and sign in again |

Settings use a hero header and section icon cards; web and Android share a green theme (`#16a34a`).

### Device workspace

- Tap a card: back, device name, **Start**
- **Cast mode:** mirror (default) or camera (Android 12+)
- **Tabbed parameters** (same shape as the web left panel, persisted per device serial):
  - Mirror: video, audio, device, screen (virtual display presets, `__main__`/`__custom__`, suggested DPI, `start_app` package)
  - Camera: camera, video, audio (`audioCode`, buffer fields, stream extras aligned with web)
- Changes auto-save when you leave the page
- **Right cast canvas:** **Start** casts inline in the workspace (settings left, canvas right); connection logs during startup (adb push / forward / shell / WebSocket), auto-hidden after the first frame
- **Cast toolbar:** docked below the device name when not fullscreen; floating bar at the bottom in fullscreen
- **Fullscreen** can reuse the active session without calling `cast/start` again

### Fullscreen cast

- **Start** opens landscape fullscreen: `POST .../cast/start` + `WebSocket .../cast/ws`, **MediaCodec** H.264, letterboxed canvas with preview rotation
- Startup logs on the canvas until the first frame is rendered
- **Mirror:** recents / home / back / power / volume / rotate / stop; touch injection (scrcpy wire format)
- **Camera:** torch, zoom out, zoom in, stop; no canvas touch injection
- Chrome **auto-hides** (~3.5 s); tap video to toggle; enter/exit fades and live-status dot animation
- Stream extras (`codecOptions`, virtual display, `audioDup` min SDK 33+, etc.) follow the **same rules** as web/desktop

### Build & install

**Requirements:** Android Studio or JDK 11+ and the Android SDK (`minSdk 28`).

```powershell
cd frontend/android
.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug
# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The phone must reach the backend on your LAN. Cleartext HTTP is allowed for local dev via `network_security_config`.

## Quick start

**Requirements (web):** Node.js 18+, authorized ADB device, Chromium-based browser with WebCodecs.

**Requirements (Android app):** same LAN as the backend; install the debug/release APK from `frontend/android` (see [Build & install](#build--install) under Android app).

**Interactive installer (terminal UI):**

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| Linux (Debian, Alpine, Fedora, Arch, …) | `bash scripts/install-linux.sh` |
| **Android (Termux)** | `bash scripts/install-termux.sh` (or `bash scripts/install.sh` auto-routes) |
| macOS | `bash scripts/install-macos.sh` |
| Windows | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-windows.ps1` |
| Auto (Linux/macOS) | `bash scripts/install.sh` |

```powershell
cd Cloud-Phone
copy .env.example .env

# Recommended: start both backend and frontend from repo root
npm run dev

# Then open http://localhost:5173 (or FRONTEND_PORT in .env)
```

Separate terminals:

```powershell
npm run dev:backend   # API, default 3000
npm run dev:frontend  # Vite UI, default 5173
```

Production preview:

```powershell
cd frontend/web
npm run start   # build then serve dist/
```

If you see an error about the scrcpy server JAR not being built, install JDK 17+ and Android SDK, then run:

```powershell
node tools/build-scrcpy-server.mjs
```

## API overview

Protected routes require a valid session cookie (sign in first). JSON bodies and responses use AES-256-GCM envelopes after login; login returns an encrypted payload derived from your password. WebSocket paths require the session cookie; large file/APK uploads use raw `PUT` streams (auth only).

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
| GET | `/api/devices` | List devices |
| GET | `/api/devices/:serial/screenshot` | Screenshot |

| * | `/api/scrcpy/*` | scrcpy sessions & capabilities |

---

## Building scrcpy

**Web cast** needs the modded `scrcpy-server` (same Android APK for every host OS; build once with Gradle):

```powershell
node tools/build-scrcpy-server.mjs
node tools/build-scrcpy-server.mjs --all-platforms   # install jar under windows/linux/macos
```

On **Linux / macOS**, if you only run the Node backend in a browser, `--all-platforms` is enough; a desktop `scrcpy` binary is optional.

Optional client build (Meson + Ninja; embeds the modded server, no `install_release.sh`):

```powershell
node tools/build-scrcpy.mjs
node tools/build-scrcpy.mjs --server-only

# Official prebuilt — server is NOT modded; do not use for web cast
# node tools/build-scrcpy.mjs --download
```

```powershell
node tools/compare-scrcpy-upstream.mjs
node tools/sync-scrcpy-from-upstream.mjs   # or sync-scrcpy-source.mjs (compat)
```

More details: [backend/source/scrcpy/CLOUD_PHONE.md](backend/source/scrcpy/CLOUD_PHONE.md).

---

## Docker

Configure root `.env` (`BACKEND_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`, `DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE`).

```bash
cd docker-cloud-phone

# Recommended: use ../.env automatically
chmod +x compose.sh
./compose.sh up -d

# Or pass env file explicitly
docker compose --env-file ../.env up -d

# Or symlink then plain docker compose up -d works
ln -sf ../.env .env && docker compose up -d

# Local single-arch build (host architecture)
./compose.sh -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build

# Multi-arch build and push to Docker Hub (requires docker login + buildx)
chmod +x build-multiarch.sh
./build-multiarch.sh
```

Open `https://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT}` (default 5173; trust the self-signed cert in the browser). On LAN use `https://<host-ip>:5173`; set `FRONTEND_TLS_SAN=<host-ip>` in `.env` to reduce warnings.

**Data persistence**: compose mounts `docker-cloud-phone/data/` to `/data` in the backend container (`auth.key`, `cloud-phone.db` for passwords and sessions). Data survives image rebuilds; the host directory is created on first start.

**iOS / Python**: the backend image includes Python 3, `pymobiledevice3`, and OpenSSL for the Apple WDA USB pipeline (install, port forward, launch); IPA re-signing uses Node `zsign-wasm`. Place `wda.ipa` at `backend/bin/wda/wda.ipa` and mount it into the container. On Linux, pass the iPhone USB device into the container (e.g. `--device /dev/bus/usb` or `privileged`) and ensure the host recognizes the device.

**Network mode (Linux host by default)**: frontend and backend share the host network stack so the API can list all host interfaces (`GET /api/host/networks`) and ADB/mDNS use real LAN addresses. On Mac/Windows Docker Desktop:

```bash
./compose.sh -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.bridge.yml up -d
```
